### How strong is the relation between corruption and dependence of natural resources extraction in Latin American countries?

### Corruption: An endemic disease?

Corruption is one of the most debated phenomena in the policy field. Due to its capacity to obstruct the efforts made to tackle the most pressing issues such as poverty and inequality reduction, and economic growth, most countries openly declare their compromises in order to reduce and avoid corruption. 

The question whether which country characteristics lead to a bigger presence of corruption is central to the discussion, taking into account that the great efforts some international organisations and countries have put in are also increasing the amount of funds aimed to fight corruption @michael2009evolution and that the discussion about anti-corruption measures has led to the creation of anti-corruption agencies and ombudsman. 

Constant research on the characteristic that can be associated with corruption could give policy makers leads to where concentrate the efforts and it could give political scientists a better understanding of the nature of the phenomenon. 
It is then relevant to this debate is whether a completely exogenous characteristic, as it is the large presence of natural resources and the national dependency of these resources, would favor higher corruption levels as the works of @leite1999does and @sala2003addressing propose. These last authors use the Nigerian case to establish a link between oil and minerals dependency and less economic growth through the erosion of institutional quality. 

This work aims at testing whether a higher dependency on natural resources could favor corruption by using the latest available worldwide data. We will consider the preliminary hypothesis that to a higher level of natural resources dependency, countries are more corrupt.

### Literature Review

Corruption is considered as the use of public office for private gain (Transparency International, 2015). Even though this definition seems quite straight forward, it does not indicate or contain many clues as to how to measure it. Previous attempts have considered to use economic measurements such as the potential PIB and the current PIB to have an estimation of the costs of corruption. However, given its hidden nature, the costs are not visible and they could easily be attributed to other phenomena.  

One of the most significant contributions to the discussion was made by @leite1999does, the researchers argue that the availability of natural resources is one of the factors on which corruption depends, along with government policies and the concentration of bureaucratic power. 

More recently, researchers have found the relation between governance levels and the dependence on natural resources to be significant, claiming that to higher dependence on the natural resources (expressed as the percentage of rents on natural resources to GDP) governance levels appear to be less as proposed by @arezki2011oil.

### Methodology

This work will aim at measuring the impact of natural resources dependency on corruption levels using yearly information (Panel Data).

Corruption, given its nature, is not easily measured. For this reason, this work will use the perception on corruption as a proxy. While biases in terms of how people perceive corruption and how it deeply imbedded in it is the country can gravely affect the results, a possible solution is to use several available indexes of corruption with different methodologies. 

On one hand, the World Governance Indicators from the World Bank provides a yearly aggregate measure of the perception of corruption done through surveys to the public and to experts on the subject. On the other hand, the Corruption Perception Index by Transparency International also captures the perception of analysts and experts on how corrupt a particular country seems to be. Another source will be the International Country Risk Guide made by the PRS Group, used in the work of @leite1999does to assess the trend on perception of corruption. These indexes could be combined into one unique index for perception of corruption to make them more robust. We also expect to test if the results of these indexes are correlated in order to ensure they capture the same phenomenon.

On the other hand, to measure the dependence of natural resources we will use The World Bank's indicator **Total Natural Resources Rents (% of GDP)** which is defined as the total natural resources rents as the sum of oil rents, natural gas rents, coal rents (hard and soft), mineral rents, and forest rents (@WDI). This indicator will let us see how the fluctuating levels of rents from natural resources affect the perception of corruption.

$$Corruption=\beta0+\beta1 Natural Resource Dependency +\beta Control Variables + \epsilon$$

Following the literature review and given that the rents from natural resources could stay at the same level but the GDP could decrease, therefore changing the percentage distribution, we will control for the state of the economy through a variable of GDP Growth. There is also academic evidence that perception of corruption fluctuates along with the economic situation of the households, as a proxy we will use the data on unemployment.  We will also control for the political stability of the country adding a variable that contains information of armed conflict. 

Finally, we will create dummy variables for the different regions in order to compare and draw more concrete conclusions.
