**Research Question**: 

### How strong is the relation between corruption and dependence of natural resources extraction?

### Corruption: An endemic disease?

Corruption is one of the most discussed terms in the field of political science given its impact on the effectiveness of policies, its negative relation with justice and rule of law and its presence as an indicator of other major challenges in the quest for better governance.

The question whether which country characteristics lead to a bigger presence of corruption has been widely discussed and often tried to be explained through empiric methods. 

The "resource curse" is a term coined to express the paradox of a low economic growth and the abundance of natural resources in a country. Researches have also found the relation between governance levels and the dependence on natural resources to be significant as well, claiming that to higher dependence on the natural resources (expressed as the percentage of rents on atural resources to GDP) governance levels appear to be less as proposed by @arezki2011oil.

But within this field, the relation between the perception of corruption levels, as a proxy to the state of governance, and the dependence on natural resources can also be measured. 

### Literature review
Corruption is defined as XXXXXXXXXXXXX

On the other hand, the dependence on natural resources extraction is XXXX

This works aims at contributing to this discussion by measuring the correlation between the perception of corruption levels and the percentage of natural resources rents to GDP.

### Methodology
This work will aim to measure the correlation between corruption and natural resource dependence through an empiric research using a Panel Data approximation (Diffs-in-Diffs)
