### How strong is the relation between corruption and dependence of natural resources extraction in Latin American countries?

### Corruption: An endemic disease?

Corruption is one of the most debated phenomena in the policy field because high levels of it are usually detected along with a weak enforcement of the law, inefficiency of investments and poor economic performance.

Due to its capacity to obstruct the efforts made to tackle most pressing issues such as poverty and inequality reduction, and economic growth, most countries openly declare they make compromises in order to reduce and avoid corruption.  Accountability and transparency are also frequently appearing in most policy texts in order to enhance the idea of a more effective and open exercise of public office duties.

Taking into account the great efforts some international organisations and countries put in, besides the fastly increasing amout of funds aimed to fight corruption @michael2009evolution, the question whether which country characteristics lead to a bigger presence of corruption is central to the discussion.

One hypothesis relevant to this debate is whether a completely exogenus chacracteristic as is the large presence of natural resources would favour higher corruption levels as the works of @leite1999does propose. This work aims at testing this hypothesis with data from Latin American countries which are considered a good source for natural resources with the last data available. This ensures the reearch also account for the latest developments in the region.

### Literature Review


One of the most significant contributions to the discussion was made by @leite1999does, the researchers argue that the availability of natural resources is one of the factors on which corruption depends, along with governemnt policies and the concentration of bureaucratic power. 

More recently, researches have found the relation between governance levels and the dependence on natural resources to be significant, claiming that to higher dependence on the natural resources (expressed as the percentage of rents on natural resources to GDP) governance levels appear to be less as proposed by @arezki2011oil.


### Methodology

This work will aim to measure the correlation between corruption and natural resource dependence at a country level and on a yearly bases through an empiric research using a Panel Data approximation (Diffs-in-Diffs) with two main datasets both from the World Bank Group.

Corruption, given its nature, is not easily measured. For this reason, this work will use the perception on corruption as a proxy. While biases in terms of how people perceive corruption and how it deeply imbedded in it is the country can gravely affect the results, a possible solution is to use several available indexes of corruption with different methodologies.

On one hand, the World Governance Indicators from the World Bank provides a yearly aggregate measure of the perception of corruption done through surveys to the public and to experts on the subject. On the other hand, the Corruption Perception Index by Transparency International also captures the perception of analysts and experts on how corrupt a particular country seems to be. Both of this indexes could be combined into one unique index for perception of corruption. 

On the other hand, The World Bank also has information on the dependence on natural resources revenuw through the indicator **Total Natural Resources Rents (% of GDP)** which is defined as the total natural resources rents as the sum of oil rents, natural gas rents, coal rents (hard and soft), mineral rents, and forest rents.
