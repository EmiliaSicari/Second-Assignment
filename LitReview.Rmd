##Literature Review

In recent decades, a signifcant amount of research in the field of Development Economics have explored the interplay of good governance and economic growth. The term "resource curse" 
@sachs2001curse 
was coined to describe a paradoxical fact about developing countries' trajectories: on average, economies with a high stock of natural resources (in particular oil, gas, and minerals) have fared less well in recent decades than countries with less natural resources.

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
